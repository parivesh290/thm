Nmap was created by Gordon Lyon (Fyodor), a network security expert and open source programmer. It was released in 1997. 

N map uses different techniques to discover live hosts:-

1. ARP scan: This scan uses ARP requests to discover live hosts
2. ICMP scan: This scan uses ICMP requests to identify live hosts
3. TCP/UDP ping scan: This scan sends packets to TCP ports and UDP ports to determine live hosts.

SUBNETWORKS:-
 A network segment is a group of computers connected using a shared medium. For instance, the medium can be the Ethernet switch or WiFi access point.
 In an IP network, a subnetwork is usually the equivalent of one or more network segments connected together and configured to use the same router.
 The network segment refers to a physical connection, while a subnetwork refers to a logical connection.
 
 ARP:- 
 ARP is a link-layer protocol, and ARP packets are bound to their subnet. the arp requests will not be routed to another subnet or blocked by router.
1.Subnets with /16, which means that the subnet mask can be written as 255.255.0.0. This subnet can have around 65 thousand hosts.
2.Subnets with /24, which indicates that the subnet mask can be expressed as 255.255.255.0. This subnet can have around 250 hosts.


Scan Type	Example Command:-
ARP Scan-	sudo nmap -PR -sn MACHINE_IP/24
ICMP Echo Scan-	sudo nmap -PE -sn MACHINE_IP/24
ICMP Timestamp Scan-	sudo nmap -PP -sn MACHINE_IP/24
ICMP Address Mask Scan-	sudo nmap -PM -sn MACHINE_IP/24
TCP SYN Ping Scan-	sudo nmap -PS22,80,443 -sn MACHINE_IP/30
TCP ACK Ping Scan-	sudo nmap -PA22,80,443 -sn MACHINE_IP/30
UDP Ping Scan	sudo- nmap -PU53,161,162 -sn MACHINE_IP/30
Remember to add -sn if you are only interested in host discovery without port-scanning. Omitting -sn will let Nmap default to port-scanning the live hosts.

Option	Purpose:-
-n       	no DNS lookup
-R      	reverse-DNS lookup for all hosts
-sn     	host discovery only

TCP/UDP scans :-

Port Scan Type	Example Command
TCP Connect Scan-    	nmap -sT 10.10.148.249
TCP SYN Scan	sudo-    nmap -sS 10.10.148.249
UDP Scan	sudo nmap-    -sU 10.10.148.249

These scan types should get you started discovering running TCP and UDP services on a target host.

Option                       	Purpose
-p-                           	all ports
-p1-1023                      	scan ports 1 to 1023
-F                            	100 most common ports
-r                             	scan ports in consecutive order
-T<0-5>	-T0                      being the slowest and T5 the fastest
--max-rate 50               	 rate <= 50 packets/sec
--min-rate 15	               rate >= 15 packets/sec
--min-parallelism 100	        at least 100 probes in parallel


This room covered the following types of scans.

Port Scan Type                                   	Example Command
TCP Null Scan           	                         sudo nmap -sN 10.10.4.50
TCP FIN Scan                                      	sudo nmap -sF 10.10.4.50
TCP Xmas Scan                                      	sudo nmap -sX 10.10.4.50
TCP Maimon Scan                                   	sudo nmap -sM 10.10.4.50
TCP ACK Scan                                      	sudo nmap -sA 10.10.4.50
TCP Window Scan                                    	sudo nmap -sW 10.10.4.50
Custom TCP Scan                                    	sudo nmap --scanflags URGACKPSHRSTSYNFIN 10.10.4.50
Spoofed Source IP                                 	sudo nmap -S SPOOFED_IP 10.10.4.50
Spoofed MAC Address                              	--spoof-mac SPOOFED_MAC
Decoy Scan                                        	nmap -D DECOY_IP,ME 10.10.4.50
Idle (Zombie) Scan                             	sudo nmap -sI ZOMBIE_IP 10.10.4.50
Fragment IP data into 8 bytes                     	-f
Fragment IP data into 16 bytes                    	-ff


Option                             	Purpose
--source-port PORT_NUM              specify source port number
--data-length NUM                   append random data to reach given length




These scan types rely on setting TCP flags in unexpected ways to prompt ports for a reply. Null, FIN, and Xmas scan provoke a response from closed ports,
while Maimon, ACK, and Window scans provoke a response from open and closed ports.

Option                                          	Purpose
--reason                                       	explains how Nmap made its conclusion
