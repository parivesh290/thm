Nmap was created by Gordon Lyon (Fyodor), a network security expert and open source programmer. It was released in 1997. 

N map uses different techniques to discover live hosts:-

1. ARP scan: This scan uses ARP requests to discover live hosts
2. ICMP scan: This scan uses ICMP requests to identify live hosts
3. TCP/UDP ping scan: This scan sends packets to TCP ports and UDP ports to determine live hosts.

SUBNETWORKS:-
 A network segment is a group of computers connected using a shared medium. For instance, the medium can be the Ethernet switch or WiFi access point.
 In an IP network, a subnetwork is usually the equivalent of one or more network segments connected together and configured to use the same router.
 The network segment refers to a physical connection, while a subnetwork refers to a logical connection.
 
 ARP:- 
 ARP is a link-layer protocol, and ARP packets are bound to their subnet. the arp requests will not be routed to another subnet or blocked by router.
1.Subnets with /16, which means that the subnet mask can be written as 255.255.0.0. This subnet can have around 65 thousand hosts.
2.Subnets with /24, which indicates that the subnet mask can be expressed as 255.255.255.0. This subnet can have around 250 hosts.


Scan Type	Example Command:-
ARP Scan-	sudo nmap -PR -sn MACHINE_IP/24
ICMP Echo Scan-	sudo nmap -PE -sn MACHINE_IP/24
ICMP Timestamp Scan-	sudo nmap -PP -sn MACHINE_IP/24
ICMP Address Mask Scan-	sudo nmap -PM -sn MACHINE_IP/24
TCP SYN Ping Scan-	sudo nmap -PS22,80,443 -sn MACHINE_IP/30
TCP ACK Ping Scan-	sudo nmap -PA22,80,443 -sn MACHINE_IP/30
UDP Ping Scan	sudo- nmap -PU53,161,162 -sn MACHINE_IP/30
Remember to add -sn if you are only interested in host discovery without port-scanning. Omitting -sn will let Nmap default to port-scanning the live hosts.

Option	Purpose:-
-n       	no DNS lookup
-R      	reverse-DNS lookup for all hosts
-sn     	host discovery only
