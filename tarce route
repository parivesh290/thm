1. The number of hops/routers between your system and the target system depends on the time you are running traceroute. There is no guarantee that your packets will always
follow the same route, even if you are on the same network or you repeat the traceroute command within a short time.

2. Some routers return a public IP address. You might examine a few of these routers based on the scope of the intended penetration testing.

3. Some routers donâ€™t return a reply.
