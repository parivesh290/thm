The TELNET (Teletype Network) protocol was developed in 1969 to communicate with a remote system via a command-line interface (CLI). Hence, the command telnet uses 
the TELNET protocol for remote administration. The default port used by telnet is 23. From a security perspective, telnet sends all the data, including usernames and 
passwords, in cleartext. Sending in cleartext makes it easy for anyone, who has access to the communication channel, to steal the login credentials. The secure
alternative is SSH (Secure SHell) protocol.


 we want to discover more information about a web server, listening on port 80. We connect to the server at port 80, and then we communicate using the HTTP protocol.
 You donâ€™t need to dive into the HTTP protocol; you just need to issue GET / HTTP/1.1. To specify something other than the default index page,
 you can issue GET /page.html HTTP/1.1, which will request page.html.
 We also specified to the remote web server that we want to use HTTP version 1.1 for communication.
 To get a valid response, instead of an error, you need to input some value for the host host: example and hit enter twice. 
 Executing these steps will provide the requested index page.
