Using null bytes is an injection technique where URL-encoded representation such as %00 or 0x00 in hex with user-supplied data to terminate strings.
You could think of it as trying to trick the web app into disregarding whatever comes after the Null Byte.

By adding the Null Byte at the end of the payload, we tell the  include function to ignore anything after the null byte which may look like:

include("languages/../../../../../etc/passwd%00").".php"); which equivalent to â†’ include("languages/../../../../../etc/passwd");

NOTE: the %00 trick is fixed and not working with PHP 5.3.4 and above.
